<h3 id="What">What</h3>
<h4 >Protection that mass-market insurance doesn't offer</h4>

<p>Private client insurers specialize in covering unique situations, and offer policies that are broad, flexible, and have many great features.</p>
<h5>Uninterrupted life</h5>
<p>Our premium insurers offer claims service designed to get your clients' lives back to normal, without hassles, headaches, or delay.</p>

<h2 id="Writing">Writing</h2>
<h3 id="Checklist">Checklist </h3>
<p>Before you start writing, please review the following questions:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Who is the target audience? Be as specific as possible (i.e., Watch collectors, People with homes in wildfire areas)</li>
<li>Will this information be useful and interesting to the defined audience? </li>
<li>Are we experts or talking with someone that is an expert?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sub-section">
<h3 id="Goals">Goals </h3>
<p>With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Educate: </strong> Help people understand Kelly Klee by using language that informs them and encourages them to make the most of our advice. Tell them what they need to know, not just what we want to say.</li>
<li><strong>Guide: </strong> We are tour guides for our readers. Whether you're leading them through a coverage plan, or instructions on how to use our app, communicate in a friendly, concise, and helpful way.</li>
<li><strong>Build credibility:  </strong> Avoid dramatic storytelling and grandiose claims. Focus on the real pitfalls of being underinsured and the strengths of Kelly Klee.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sub-section">
<h3 id="Voice">Voice</h3>
<p>Kelly Klee is an insurance advisor and advocate for successful families. It's not enough to give our clients the right advice, they need an understanding of the reasons for our recommendation, and the confidence they are making the best decision for their needs. 
</p>
<p>When we write copy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We are clear:  </strong>Insurance can be hard to understand and is often muddled by legalese, hyperbolic language, upsells, and over-promises. We strip all that away and value clarity above all.</li>
<li><strong>We are understanding:  </strong>We understand the challenges and passions of successful individuals.</li>
<li><strong>We are translators:  </strong>Our job is to demystify insurance and educate our clients and not to show off how much we know. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sub-section">
<h3 id="Tone">Tone</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Concise: </strong>We want to be respectful of our reader's time and intelligence. Get to the point and provide the reader value for the time they are investing with us. Our content also needs to be easy for the reader to grasp. The goal is to communicate the content, not to show how smart we are. </li>
<li><strong>Knowledgeable:</strong> Be confident with the subject matter.  If you are not an expert on what you are writing about, be sure to reference a source that is.</li>
<li><strong>Trustworthy: </strong>Build a sense of trustworthiness by making your writing sincere. Referencing numbers, data, and other trusted sources of information are an excellent way to make your case and build credibility with the reader. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sub-section">
<h3 id="Style">Style</h3>
<p>When in doubt: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/"> Chicago Manual of Style. </a></li>
<li>Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com">Merriam-Webster Dictionary.</a></li>
<li>Use an active voice. Avoid passive voice.</li>
<li>Avoid slang and jargon. Write in plain English.</li>
<li>Use positive language rather than negative language.</li>
<li>Use serial (a.k.a Oxford) commas. </li>
<li>Avoid exclamation points and hyperbole.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sub-section">
<h3 id="Terminology">Insurance terminology</h3>
<p>General guidelines:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Use the term that best describes the product or coverage feature to someone that doesn't know insurance.</li>
<li>Include the insurance term-of-art, in addition, if it adds clarity or has specific coverage or legal implications. </li>
<li>Use the term “insurer” rather than “carrier”.</li>
<li>Use the word coverage over insurance where possible.</li>
</ul>
